## 1 Programming languages
```
###---Main goal---###
Learn the basic usage of each language
- understand data types,variables
- understand loop
- understand condition
- learn to use terminal
```
## Programming languages

- Python
- R
- shell

## Recommendation books and websites
```
I would highly recommend to read "Computing Skills for Biologists A Toolbox"
```
- Python Programming website (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp)
- R Programming Website (https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/introduction-to-r.html)
- [Computing Skills for Biologists A Toolbox](./text_book/Computing_Skills_for_Biologists_A_Toolbox.pdf)

## 2 Important envirnment management Softwares

```
###---Main goal---###
- learn to use programming supportive platform
- learn to manage environments and packages
- learn to version control
```
### 2-1 programming packages management Software

- Anaconda(https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- learn to use conda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)

```
comments: anaconda is useful tool for  python packages and enviroments management
```
### 2-2 Integrated development environment(IDE) Software

- Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- learn to create first project (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-running-your-first-python-project.html)
- learn to create conda env on pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html#conda-requirements)

```
comments: pycharm is a powerful IDE for different programming languages (support Python, R, etc.). It is used for code writing, testing and debugging.
```

### 2-2 Version control

- git and github (https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
- add VS on Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/version-control-integration.html)

```
comments: verson control is extremely important since it will track all changes you made to the files
```
## 3 Important packages

```
###---Main goal---###
understand the main functions of each package
```
### 3-1 python packages

- Biopython (http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
- Pandas
- prody
- Igblast
- PyIR
- git
- snakemake
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- pytorch
- tensorflow


```
comments: 
#1 Biopython is super helpful package for biological application, so I highly recommend go throughly its tutorial
#2 I also provide some cheatsheets on the text_book file for assisting programming
```
### 3-2 R packages

- ggplot2 (http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials)
- dplyr
- ggpubr


## 4 Applications

```
###---Main goal---###
run and test some toy experiments
```
### 4-1 Bioinformatics
### 4-1-1 Deep Mutational Scanning analyses
- H3N2 NA antigenic region DMS (https://github.com/Wangyiquan95/NA_EPI)
### 4-1-2 NGS analyses
- H3N2 HA egg-passaging adaptation (https://github.com/Wangyiquan95/HA_egg_passage)
- SARS-CoV-2 cell culture-adaptive mutations (https://github.com/nicwulab/SARS-CoV-2_in_vitro_adaptation)
### 4-2 Machine learning
- Deep learning model for antigen identification (https://github.com/nicwulab/SARS-CoV-2_Abs)
- H3N2 NA antigenic region DMS regression (https://github.com/Wangyiquan95/NA_EPI)
